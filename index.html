<h1>All We Can Save</h1>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>A lot of us have climate change on our radar, but find it complicated to get involved or start learning.</p>
<p>It's a topic can be intimidating, or feel unfortunately trendy.</p>
<p>But there's literally something for everyone when it comes to caring about "the climate", and approaches abound: science, spiritualism, activism, art, urban planning, history, etc.</p>


<section class="what">
  <h2>What</h2>
  <p><p>We're hoping to make a low-key event for learning and discussion. Not something that takes the topic casually, but not something perscriptive. Just a space with the minimum structure for people to stay still something that provides miniumum structure necessary for people to stay in touch on this issue.</p>
<p>Something communal, interesting, reliable: <b>chat about climate change and eat crepes together once every-other month.</p>
  <p>That's it. If other things bloom out of this (activism, field trips, art project) then cool! If not, at least we ate crepes.</p>
  <p>We'll use the book, All We Can Save, as a common touchstone to get the conversation started. But we'll take it slow! We encourage you to read the last chapter of <a src="" target="_blank">the book</a> and/or listen to <a src="" target="_blank">this podcast</a>.</p>
