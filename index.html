<h1>All We Can Save</h1>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>A lot of us have climate change on our radar, but find it complicated to get involved or start learning.</p>
<p>It's a topic that can be intimidating and feel, these days, trendy. But, it's important!</p>
<p>There's something for everyone in talking about "the climate", and approaches abound: science, spiritualism, activism, art, urban planning, history, scuba diving, etc.</p>


<section class="what">
  <h2>What</h2>
  <p>We're hoping to make a low-key event for learning about nature, climate change, and our local community. It won't be something that treats topics lightly, but it also won't be very formal. Just a space with the minimum structure for people to stay in touch.</p>
  <p>It will be communal and reliable: a chance to <b>chat about earth + eat crepes together every-other month.</b></p>
  <p>That's it. If other things bloom out of this (activism, field trips, art projects) then cool! If not, at least we ate crepes.</p>

<section class="whatmore">
  <h2>What more</h2>
  <p>We'll use the book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.allwecansave.earth">All We Can Save</a>, as a common touchstone to get started.</p>
  <p>The book is an anthology of writings by 60 women at the forefront of the climate movement.</>
   <p>We encourage you to read the chapter <i>"Community is our Best Chance"</i>, by Christine Nieves-Rodriguez, and/or listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Iswit8oviikYThWYDZR6N?si=a0927d9f4018485e" target="_blank">this podcast episode</a> by our first meeting.</p>
  <p>If you or anyone else needs a copy of the book, just ask! We have plenty.</p>
